# Rules of „Zing“

## Origin

This game obviously comes from Montenegro, but seems to be relatively unknown there as well. "Zing" is pronounced "sing".

## Deck and Players

The game is played with a **52-card deck** (2-10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace; no jokers), with **two or four players** (when playing with four, two opposite players always play together).

## Preparation and Start

**Each player is dealt four cards** (usually dealt in a 2-card rhythm) to their hand.

**At the beginning, four cards are placed face up on the table** (fanned out so that one card is on top but the others are still visible, just to know which cards are still in play). Due to these first four cards, the remaining 48 cards will always evenly distribute among the players (dealing hands of four) during the game.

The player to the left of the dealer goes first.

The bottom card from the dealer's deck is turned over and rotated so that everyone can see it during the game (until the last cards are dealt). This way, the dealer, who has an advantage, has to reveal their last card.

If a Jack is on top at the beginning, it is pushed to the bottom of the pile and effectively belongs to the dealer (since they deal themselves the last four cards). This card also remains visible, so in this case, the dealer has two cards known to everyone on their last hand.

## Gameplay

**Cards are always played round robin,** taking turns clockwise around the table, placing a single card onto the table pile, without exceptions that would change the order. The goal is to get as many tricks with as many cards or actually as many points as possible. The player to the left of the dealer begins.

The current trick is won with the same card (of any suit, for example, 5 on 5) as the topmost card of the open pile, or with a Jack as a trump card.  Winning a trick does not change the order in any way; players continue taking turns, playing a single card each.

The relevant card is always the topmost card on the table; the first four cards at the beginning are only fanned out face up so that one can see which cards are already in play.

When all the cards from a player's hand have been played, four new ones are dealt to each player (but none are placed on the table like at the beginning) by the same dealer throughout the game (until all the cards are gone).

## Zing

If you win a trick with a solo card (not with a jack but with the same card), you get an extra ten points - that's a Zing.

To mark this, the played card is placed face up under the player's score pile, rotated 90 degrees. (This also ensures that the two identical cards are not on top of each other, which makes shuffling easier.)

A Zing with a Jack on a solo Jack ("Jack-Zing") is worth 20 points. (That's why everyone will usually try to avoid playing a jack onto the empty table, after a trick was won.)

Zings are crucial to winning a game.

## End and Scoring

At the end of the game, the player who won the last trick takes the remaining cards from the table.

The scoring is as follows: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace each count as one point, except for the Ten of Diamonds (two points) and the Two of Clubs, which also counts as one point. In total, there are 22 points.

The player with the most cards gets an additional three points, but this bonus is canceled in the event of a tie.  Then, the aforementioned 10 extra points per Zing are added, or 20 points for a Jack-Zing.

The first player to collect 101 points over several games wins the match. Often, Zing is played until the first player has won two or three matches.

## Tips

**Shuffling well is very important in Zing,** which is why the card with which you make a trick is often placed under the pile, so that the two identical cards do not lie directly on top of each other.

By making a trick, you open up the chance for a Zing and thus for victory, since the next player has to play a "naked" card.

An easy way to count is to count the values in the smaller pile and distribute a total of 25 points (without Zing, but with the three points for most cards).

If the piles seem to be about the same size, among friends who trust each other, one person counts the cards and the other person counts the points.
