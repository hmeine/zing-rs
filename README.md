Zing Game
=========

This is a WIP implementation of a simple, but very fun card game named "Zing",
apparently originating in Montenegro.

The idea to implement an electronic edition came to me during the pandemic, when
people were staying home and playing online games was a good way to socialize
with your peers or to have teambuilding activities for new groups.

At the time of writing, the status is that it is not playable online yet,
although it feels as if it is 95% done.  I am also using it as a fun project to
learn and practice Rust in, and I have been doing it in my limited "spare" time
only, besides work and family, so there have been (and always will be) longish
stretches of non-activity.
